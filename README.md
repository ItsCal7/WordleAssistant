Wordle Assistant

Sorts through the possible words that can be inputted into Wordle and finds all the words that it could still be given the logic. 
This is not a wordle solver, it doesn't tell you the most likely word for it to be, just all the ones it could be. 
You still have to make guesses for it to work. 
If you type 'e' you can activate easy mode and it will sort through the significantly shorter list of words that can be wordle answers.
